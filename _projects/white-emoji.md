**Where:** [The Atlantic.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/white-people-dont-use-white-emoji/481695/)

**Why:** My office uses Slack to communicate, which has native emoji support. I noticed that while many of my coworkers of color used darker-toned emoji, pretty much all of my white colleagues — including myself — preferred yellow emoji. 

**How:** The meat of this analysis comes from a sampling of Twitter's [realtime tweet stream,](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview) filtering U.S. tweets for messages with emoji and then cataloging the skin tones used. I then compared the relative incidence of emoji tones to the reported demographics of U.S. Twitter users.

**What I learned:** As expected, white people don't use white emoji. The story's reporting gave me a deeper understanding of why, and why defaulting to the yellow emoji is also fraught.
