**Where:** You can read the [original article,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/super-campaign-dodger/462531/) but the embed is kaput; [go here instead.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/the-atlantic/ads-game/index.html)

**Why:** I wanted to show readers the sheer number of campaign ads barreling through Iowa's airwaves in the run-up to the 2016 caucuses. When my [first shot](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/02/how-our-first-arcade-game-grew-from-a-terrible-infographic/463032/) at a data visualization fizzled, I wondered if there was a more interactive way to put readers in Iowans' shoes.

**How:** I built this in JavaScript using [D3](https://www.d3js.org/) and [real data.](https://politicaladarchive.org/)

**What I learned:** A lot about game mechanics! Also, animating thousands of HTML blocks down a user's screen will eventually turn their processor into a white-hot brick â€” unless you do it efficiently ðŸ˜Š
