**Where:** [The original article,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/is-violence-in-america-going-up-or-down/491384/) though the embed is broken; I wrote a [blog post](http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2019/01/13/making-the-guess-graph-module.html) on the updated `<guess-graph>` component with examples.

**Why:** Trend data is important but sometimes doesn't make an impression on readers. I wanted to see if having readers draw their best guess at a trend would make them more receptive to a counterintuitive reality.

**How:** This originally was a one-off interactive for a story on homicide rates. I subsequently built Guess Graph into a reusuable web component, [available on Github.](https://github.com/arm5077/guess-graph)

**What I learned:** More than 11,000 people interacted with the graphic; I collected the aggregate guesses in a separate [post.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/07/we-asked-people-to-draw-the-murder-rate-heres-what-they-guessed/492527/) But I'm still looking for good ways to test whether this form makes people more open-minded to new information.
