**Where:** [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/theplatinumpatients/)

**Why:** The American health care system is quite expensive compared to other industrialized nations. We wanted to see how the high amount spent on the small slice of sickest patients contributed to that total.

**How:** I used R to analyze the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for this story, a massive dataset maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It's a great source because while it relies on household surveys to get information on medical expenses, it follows up with medical providers to verify the information.

**What I learned:** The sickest 5 percent of Americans account for about 50 percent of the nation's medical costs, a staggering proportion. I also loved working with [Polygraph](http://polygraph.cool/), who contributed coding and design help.
