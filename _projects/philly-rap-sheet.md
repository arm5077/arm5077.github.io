**Where:** I shut down Philly Rap Sheet several years ago, but you can see it on [The Internet Archive.](http://web.archive.org/web/20121110230000/http://www.phillyrapsheet.com/)

**Why:** As a local reporter at The (Allentown) Morning Call, one of my duties was to drive out to the offices of local judges and page through arrest reports, looking for crimes of interest. I wrote a scraper that pulled these records digitally from the comfort of my desk; I used the same scraper to launch Philly Rap Sheet, which focused on my hometown of Philadelphia.

**How:** The scraper itself was a terrible PHP script. Come to think of it, so was the website. This was one of my first major server-side programming projects. 

**Media mentions:** [Neiman Journalism Lab.](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/monday-qa-andrew-mcgill-on-philly-rap-sheet-his-automatic-arrest-tracker/)

**What I learned:** A lot about programming. But even more about ethics. Once folks showed up on Philly Rap Sheet, they were there permanently; I didn't rescrape the data. In months and years after I launched, I received many take-down requests from people who had their records expunged, and a few letters from lawyers, too. Eventually, I decided it was unethical to make this data publicly Google-able without updating it, and I shut Philly Rap Sheet down.
