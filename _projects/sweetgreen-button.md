**Where:** My desk! But also, this post at [The Atlantic.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/08/sweetgreen-button-salad-make-every-week/496955/)

**Why:** I love Sweetgreen. Their salads are really good. So is their app. But since I often buy the same thing, why not make something that automatically buys it for me? That way, I can just walk over and pick it up. 

**How:** I reverse-engineered Sweetgreen's ordering API, wrote a script with my payment information, and configured an Amazon Dash Button to order a Guacomole Greens salad (no onions!).

**What I learned:** Salads are good! Also, companies choose the worst times to change their undocument APIs and ruin your lunch ðŸ˜¡

**Media mentions:** Envoy's [_Office Hacks_](https://soundcloud.com/envoy-office-hacks) podcast did an [episode](https://soundcloud.com/envoy-office-hacks/35-the-atlantics-lunch-button) on the button.
