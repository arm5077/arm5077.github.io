**Where:** [http://localhost:4000/projects/#2](dccherrypicker.com)

**Why:** Washington's cherry trees are beautiful. But while everyone rushes down to the Tidal Basin to see them during peak bloom season, there are tons of trees planted elsewhere in the city that are just as pretty.

**How:** DC's Urban Forestry Department maintains a [database](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/urban-forestry-street-trees) of all street trees cared for by the city. I dropped this data into a Postgresql/PostGIS database and built a mobile web app allowing you to search by location and see details.

**What I learned:** Cherry trees are awesome, no matter where they are. Also, browsers have become increasingly strict about allowing access to the user's location.
