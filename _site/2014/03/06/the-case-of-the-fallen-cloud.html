		<p>Last month, someone dropped a crumpled Kleenex in the stairwell of my girlfriend’s apartment building.  No one — myself included — wanted to pick it up. It sat there for weeks, a miniature rebuke to all of us.</p>

<p>Yes, I could have just cleaned it up. But what happened next was more fun — and gave me a new respect for my neighbors.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud1.jpeg" alt="The scene of the crime." /></p>

<p>I bought a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bachmann-Trains-33104-Police-Squad/dp/B001RG29W8">Bachmann Trains miniature police officers</a> and set up a perimeter around the tissue, securing them to the floor with double-sided tape.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud2.jpeg" alt="Two officers reporting to their lieutenant." /></p>

<p>No, the patrol officers aren’t wearing Pittsburgh uniforms — but the white-shirted lieutenant would fit in!</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud3.jpg" alt="An attempt at communication." /></p>

<p>I figured I’d leave it up for a day or two and then clean the whole mess up. But the next day… this showed up.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud4.jpg" alt="How surprising!" /></p>

<p>The text: “Clouds fall from the sky/No one wants to notice them/Art makes us all smile. ” What an awesome neighbor!</p>

<p>I left behind a thank you…</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud5.jpg" alt="Thanks for the support!" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud6.jpg" alt="A close-up of the grateful crew." /></p>

<p>The next day, got one final message back:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/cloud7.jpg" alt="Sunflower." /></p>

<p>Sometimes it pays to sit back and see where things go.</p>
