		<p>Three years ago, following the <a href="http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-a-bendy-mangnifier">advice</a> of builder-journalist John Keefe, I resolved to make something new every week.</p>

<p>At the time, I wrote and coded for <em>The Atlantic</em>’s politics section, and my editor might have argued building every week was <em>already</em> my job. But these projects were supposed to be different — off-the-cuff engineering hacks, with learning something new as the primary objective.</p>

<p>What I quickly figured out: <strong>making something every week is hard.</strong> In the end, I made only five things, and sometimes they took a lot more than a week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2016/06/26/a-summer-of-make-every-week.html">A Capital Bikeshare Pebble smartwatch app (RIP Pebble);</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/07/05/make-every-week-2-slack-doorbell.html">A Slack-powered doorbell;</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/07/18/make-every-week-dmv-tracker.html">A computer vision script that monitored the lines at the DC DMV;</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/08/19/make-every-week-sweetgreen-salad-button.html">A button that ordered Sweetgreen salads for me;</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/11/22/real-life-harry-potter-lumos-spell-snowboy.html">A light that turned on when I said the magic word.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But it was fun!</p>

<p>So it’s back. For 2019, I’m resolving to <strong>Make Every (Two) Week(s),</strong> launching a new project or improving an old one twice a month. These won’t always be perfectly polished — sometimes they’ll just be a non-functioning prototype. But I miss having the pressure of a publication deadline to keep me honest and busy.</p>

<p>This time, things will be different. Each month, I’ll have two mandatory go-live dates — on the second and fourth Sundays of each month, I have to publish <em>something.</em> Revisiting a project over multiple weeks is fine, but I should pursue something substantive, like a round of user-testing or a major enhancement.</p>

<p>I’ve already picked out my first project, which will be turning the one-off “draw the line” interactive I built for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/is-violence-in-america-going-up-or-down/491384/">this story</a> on declining homicide rates into a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements">reuseable web component.</a> Here’s a shortlist of what other stuff I might dive into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An algorithmically generated magazine;</li>
  <li>A website to help you quickly rank your favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> movies;</li>
  <li>An app to help teams see where their members fall on the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/low_concept/2012/06/what_kind_of_muppet_are_you_chaos_or_order_.html">“chaos-order muppet scale”</a>;</li>
  <li>An app to help worker bees quickly surface ideas to top leadership;</li>
  <li>???</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="arm5077@gmail.com">Hit me up</a> if you’ve got a great idea. Otherwise, let the making begin!</p>
