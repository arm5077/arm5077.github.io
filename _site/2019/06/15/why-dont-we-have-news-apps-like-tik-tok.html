		<p>I’m newly obsessed by TikTok, the social video platform that combines the best parts of Vine and a casino slot machine. Its interface is easy. IT shows me just one thing at a time. And the algorithm powering it is uncannily good at learning my tastes and serving up what I like.</p>

<iframe height="700" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6646016679396510981" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 100%; max-width: 350px"></iframe>

<p>Why aren’t more news apps like this? I recognize there’s a big difference between quality journalism and funny videos, but I don’t see a single major news app emulating the awesome, serendipitous user interfaces we’re seeing from social media companies.</p>

<p>I think three things apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>News apps (and homepages) are generally organized around breadth.</strong> They want to show you all the stuff that’s going on, instead of directing your attention to a single thing, or series of things.</li>
  <li><strong>New organizations prize curation and editing, and are reluctant to surrender that judgement to algorithms.</strong> (Vox and Flipboard use computer logic to determine the best homepage layout, but not the stories being displayed.)</li>
  <li><strong>News apps don’t want to look frivolous.</strong> A lot of the newest ways to navigate apps – swiping, tapping – have been pioneered by companies news orgs would rather not be associated with. No editor-in-chief wants to hear, “Oh, your app is just like Tinder!”</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not arguing that these positions are <em>wrong</em> – though I look askance at being conservative for conservativeness’s sake. But I do wonder if a more serendipitous, easier-to-navigate news app would appeal to people in interstitial moments, those times when you’re waiting in line or taking a Lyft and just want something to occupy your attention.</p>

<p>A few apps (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/economist-espresso/id896628003">Economist Espresso,</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/refinery29-this-am-top-8-news-headlines-updates/id988472315">Refinery29 This AM,</a> the now-defunct <a href="https://digiday.com/media/quartz-is-shutting-down-its-quartz-brief-mobile-app-july-1/">Quartz Briefing</a>) have tried to hit this target. But right now, my go-to is TikTok or Instagram. Is there room for something more intellectually fulfilling?</p>

<h2 id="a-proposal">A proposal</h2>
<p>I’d argue a place like The Atlantic actually has a good mix of content for a TikTok-type app. Instead of simply relaying the news, most of its stories consider a question or pose an argument. And a lot of its stuff falls nicely into the “wonder-and-delight” category that could grab people immediately.</p>

<p>Here’s how it would work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First, get good content.</strong> Pull The Atlantic’s 500 best-performing stories, and strip out political news. That way, we get stories we know people have enjoyed, but are also less likely to be flash-in-the-pan spot coverage.</li>
  <li><strong>Guarantee a surprise.</strong> Every time the reader opens the app, it shows them a new single-screen promo to an interesting story. It can be simple – maybe just the headline, a deck, and the amount of time it would take to read the full story.</li>
  <li><strong>Give them a choice.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the reader is interested in a story, they tap it. A screen pops up with the full story text, which they can scroll through or dismiss.</li>
      <li>If they’re not interested, they swipe up. Boom! They get a new story.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Keep doing this forever.</strong> Once the reader swipes through the first set of stories, we pull another 500.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/atlantic-tiktok-images/wireframe.png" alt="Here's a wireframe of the proposal." /></p>

<p>We’d need to record which stories they’ve read or swipe through, so we avoid showing them again. And it might be nice to have a “save-for-later” function – if they’re interested but don’t have enough time in the elevator, they can bookmark a story.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not saying this replaces an organization’s news app. It’s still important to have the editors’ voice saying, “These are the stories you <em>should</em> read!” But as a complimentary app, or even a tab within a larger site, I think this could be pretty fun.</p>
