title: Building “Omniturebot,” a Slack bot for keeping tabs on traffic
---
One of my everyday frustrations as a journalist is the veritable symphony of mouse clicks required to get web traffic stats for your stories.

Yes, Chartbeat is super easy to use. But it only tracks concurrent users, not unique visitors or pageviews, which your bosses actually care about. And pulling those stats from Google Analytics or Omniture quickly devolves into a multi-step nightmare that makes setting the clock on your microwave after a power outage look downright enjoyable.

At The Atlantic, we use Omniture, or whatever Adobe is calling it these days. We also use Slack, the popular work chat client, which offers extensive scripting and automation capabilities.

After a day of one too many segment-selections and filter-applications, I asked myself, couldn’t a robot do this better?
