desc: A resolution to stretch my mind and build a new tool (and preferably a physical thing!) every week this summer.

In 2015, WNYC journalist and developer John Keefe [resolved to build a new thing every week.](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-a-bendy-mangnifier) By the end of the year, he had designed [a wind-sensing candle,](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-wind-sensor-candle), [a homemade fitness wristband](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-fitness-wristband), [a lunch-suggesting Slack bot](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-lunch-bot), and [much more.](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-begets-a-book) I loved following along throughout the year and seeing what he thought of next.

So here's my own resolution: Every week this summer, I'll build something new myself. It'll ideally have some presence in the physical world, though I'm willing to be lazy some weeks and build web-only tools. And it can't be something I'm already doing for work, because that's cheating. 

Beyond that, I'll try to avoid being too picky. I mostly want to keep the pump of creativity primed; it's a lot easier to think of new ideas when you're already working on something!
