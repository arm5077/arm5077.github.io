Three years ago, following the [advice](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-a-bendy-mangnifier) of builder-journalist John Keefe, I resolved to make something new every week. 

At the time, I wrote and coded for _The Atlantic_'s politics section, and my editor might have argued building every week was _already_ my job. But these projects were supposed to be different — off-the-cuff engineering hacks, with learning something new as the primary objective.

What I quickly figured out: **making something every week is hard.** In the end, I made only five things, and sometimes they took a lot more than a week:

* [A Capital Bikeshare Pebble smartwatch app (RIP Pebble);](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2016/06/26/a-summer-of-make-every-week.html)
* [A Slack-powered doorbell;](http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/07/05/make-every-week-2-slack-doorbell.html)
* [A computer vision script that monitored the lines at the DC DMV;](http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/07/18/make-every-week-dmv-tracker.html)
* [A button that ordered Sweetgreen salads for me;](http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/08/19/make-every-week-sweetgreen-salad-button.html)
* [A light that turned on when I said the magic word.](http://www.andrewmcgill.me/2016/11/22/real-life-harry-potter-lumos-spell-snowboy.html)

But it was fun!

So it's back. For 2019, I'm resolving to **Make Every (Two) Week(s),** launching a new project or improving an old one twice a month. These won't always be perfectly polished — sometimes they'll just be a non-functioning prototype. But I miss having the pressure of a publication deadline to keep me honest and busy.

This time, things will be different. Each month, I'll have two mandatory go-live dates — on the second and fourth Sundays of each month, I have to publish _something._ Revisiting a project over multiple weeks is fine, but I should pursue something substantive, like a round of user-testing or a major enhancement.

I've already picked out my first project, which will be turning the one-off "draw the line" interactive I built for [this story](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/is-violence-in-america-going-up-or-down/491384/) on declining homicide rates into a [reuseable web component.](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements) Here's a shortlist of what other stuff I might dive into:

* An algorithmically generated magazine;
* A website to help you quickly rank your favorite [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) movies;
* An app to help teams see where their members fall on the ["chaos-order muppet scale"](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/low_concept/2012/06/what_kind_of_muppet_are_you_chaos_or_order_.html);
* An app to help worker bees quickly surface ideas to top leadership;
* ???
