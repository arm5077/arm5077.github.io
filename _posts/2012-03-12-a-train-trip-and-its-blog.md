Last week, I took a week-long train ride from Philadelphia to Tucson, AZ for a friend’s wedding. Part-luxury liner, part-Greyhound bus, my trip put me in front of some great scenery and some hilarious people. (Think a woman taking shots at 10 in the morning, a 19-year-old power-washing entrepreneur and some unnaturally cheery staff members.)

I blogged the 4-day experience on a Tumblr, [“Train of Thought,”](http://andrewonatrain.tumblr.com/) pulling together more than 40 posts of observations, Instagrams and chance dialogue. I enjoyed the challenge of narrating my own trip (especially in the signal-less reaches of the Arizona desert) and found picking specific memories to put on the blog gave some clarity to me, as well.

I’d love to hear your thoughts.
