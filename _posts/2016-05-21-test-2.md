I’m late to my own news, but I’m excited to say I’m now working at The Atlantic, an awesome publication in Washington, D.C. I’ve joined their politics team and will be writing and coding about the 2016 election and beyond.

It’s a return from reporting after a year supervising the graphics department at National Journal. I’m pumped to produce my own work again. And The Atlantic has already proved to be an interesting place to work — an ideas magazine that cares about good writing and values a sense of fun. Onward.
